This folder contains three different projects that were given as part of the Computer Vision course.

1. Quest1 is dealing with the basics of image processing and data preprocessing, including the MNIST dataset.

2. Quest2 is dealing with faces dataset, including preprocessing and face swap, using OpenCV and other useful tools.

3. Quest3 is dealing with the training of different models to detect faces in the dataset described before:
	- First, training a VGG16 architecture by building a representing class, using Pytorch.
	- Second, using transfer learning -- training some Torchvision pre-trained models on the faces dataset.

## Instructions: ##
The relevant notebooks are available, but the model weights and the faces dataset are not due to privacy issues. It is only possible to use the code, and examine the results.

More information is found in the assignment .pdf files.
